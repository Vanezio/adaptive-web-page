# adaptive-web-page

Project is wip, the further refactor of js and css is needed!

Big css and js files because they've been took from a bigger project in which lead developer have desided to not make a different file for every different page. And also I haven't been able to get scss file, only css that after compile.
The page present in the repo is entierly my work, some of it looks weird because I've deleted all of the clients brands and product names.
